/***** To do Optionnal*****/

- several instances ?
- keep cursor position when enable/disable hilight mode  and toogle on off textarea


/***** BUGS ****/



/****** Lacks *****/
- Quite slower when page have other content => don't know why
- can't change font-size on IE due to the fact that for IE \t= a given width and not a given number of white spaces
- Mozilla, and opera have problems with mouse wheel
- Mozila don't accept "width: 100%" for width of the source textarea (textarea will expend alone...)
- The resize icon have bottom-margin => don't know why
- error with display on the bottom toolbar on firefox with doctype xhtml strict

/*** HIGHLIHTS bugs***/
- when all the content is replaced with a new one (ctrl+A and Ctrl+v ) there is a desyncronisation
- when there is new tab enter there is desyncronisation



/*** HIGHLIHTS Lacks***/
- far from perfect
- probably not the best optimised reg exp

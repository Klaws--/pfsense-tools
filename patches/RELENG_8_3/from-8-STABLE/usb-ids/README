These patches are specific to FreeBSD 8.3.

They can be safely dropped as soon as pfSense switches to a base 
FreeBSD with following versions: > 8.3, >= 9.1 or -CURRENT as of 
writing.

This adds some USB device IDs missing in FreeBSD 8.3 that we previously
had local patches for but now have been upstreamed.

This backport is specific to FreeBSD 8.3.

These patches can be safely dropped as soon as
pfSense switches to base FreeBSD > 8.3, >= 9.1 or >=10.

We omit patches that are not required to make functional
patches for bge apply, where possible. Manpage updates also 
shipped in case we do builds that would include them.

Tracks 8-STABLE where possible, last sync: Sat, 27 Oct 2012
